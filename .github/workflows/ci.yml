# .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# This workflow sets up Continuous Integration for the ConnectoViz project.
# It runs tests, linters, and type checkers across different Python versions
# on every push to the main branch and for every pull request.

name: CI

# Triggers the workflow on pushes to the 'main' branch
# and on all pull requests.

# Define jobs that will be executed as part of this workflow.
